# Dr. Who API

This project was created with:
- json-server

A mock API that details the Doctor and their companions from 2005 to the present. 

I created this API with help from Ania Kubow's tutorial *[Make your own mock API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLnxgSZ0DG4)*.

## Run this project locally

`npm start`
Starts the server on (http://localhost:4000/)

Visit (http://localhost:4000/companions) for a list of companions.
