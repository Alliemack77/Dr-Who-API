# Dr. Who API

This project was created with:

- json-server
- heroku

A mock API that details every Doctor and their companion(s) from 2005 to the present. 

I created this project with help from Ania Kubow's tutorial *[Make your own mock API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLnxgSZ0DG4)*.

## Use this API
